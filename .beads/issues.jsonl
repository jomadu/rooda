Expose all framework capabilities through a CLI that supports named procedures, explicit OODA phase flags, global options, and helpful error messages.\n\nv2 scope (from README): Command-line argument parsing, procedure invocation, help text.\n\nv2 additions over v1: --dry-run flag, --context flag for runtime hints, --unlimited flag for unlimited iterations, --verbose flag for streaming AI CLI output, --max-iterations with 1-indexed user-facing values, structured help with procedure descriptions from config metadata, Go flag parsing instead of bash case/shift.\n\nNote: Resume subcommand has been removed from scope — the loop does not persist state. If interrupted, the user simply runs again and the AI picks up from file-based state.\n\nv1 archive reference: archive/specs/cli-interface.md — covers procedure-based and explicit-flag invocation, short flags, verbose/quiet modes, and iteration defaults. Use as starting point but redesign for Go CLI conventions.\n\nTemplate sections: Job to be Done, Activities, Acceptance Criteria, Data Structures, Algorithm, Edge Cases, Dependencies, Implementation Mapping, Examples, Notes.\n\nCross-references: configuration.md (J4 — loop section with default_max_iterations, failure_threshold), iteration-loop.md (J1), prompt-composition.md (J2), observability.md (J9).","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"maxdunn123@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-06T16:10:43.577808-08:00","created_by":"max dunn","updated_at":"2026-02-07T21:11:21.312269-08:00","deleted_at":"2026-02-07T21:11:21.312269-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"task"}
