# Orient: Publish

## R21: Parse Draft Plan Structure

Analyze the draft plan file:
- What format is the plan? (markdown bullets, structured sections, etc.)
- How are tasks organized? (by priority, by category, by dependency)
- What information is included per task? (title, description, acceptance criteria)
- Are priorities explicit or implicit?
- Are dependencies documented?
- Is the plan complete and ready to publish?

## R22: Understand Task Breakdown and Dependencies

Analyze the task structure:
- How many tasks are defined?
- What is the dependency graph? (which tasks block others)
- What can be parallelized? (independent tasks)
- What must be sequential? (dependent tasks)
- Are there epics or parent-child relationships?
- What priorities are assigned?
- What task types are present? (feature, bug, refactor, etc.)
- Are descriptions clear and actionable?
