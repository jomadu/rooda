# Act: Plan

## A8: Write Draft Plan File per AGENTS.md

Write the draft plan to the location specified in AGENTS.md:
- Use prioritized bullet-point task list format
- Most important tasks first
- Include task descriptions (clear, actionable)
- Document dependencies if applicable
- Include acceptance criteria where relevant
- Make it complete - plans are disposable, cheap to regenerate

## A6: Incorporate Learnings into AGENTS.md

If operational learnings occurred during planning:
- **Incorporate into existing sections** - Update commands, paths, or criteria where they live
- **Add inline rationale** - Brief comment explaining why (e.g., "# Using X instead of Y - reason")
- **Don't append diary entries** - No dated logs like "YYYY-MM-DD: discovered X"
- Examples: discovered new patterns → update definitions; clarified criteria → refine Quality Criteria section

## A2: Commit Changes

Commit draft plan and any AGENTS.md updates:
- Descriptive commit message
- What plan was created (story/bug/gap/refactor)
- What was learned
- Reference source (story ID, bug ID, etc.)
