# Decide: Gap Plan

## D9: Structure Plan by Priority (Most Important First)

Based on gap analysis, order the tasks:
- What are the critical gaps? (missing core features, security issues)
- What are the high-impact gaps? (frequently used functionality)
- What are the low-priority gaps? (nice-to-have, edge cases)
- What depends on other tasks?
- What can be parallelized?
- What blocks other work?

Most important first.

## D10: Break into Tight, Actionable Tasks

For each gap identified:
- Is it small enough for one iteration? (tight task)
- Is it clearly defined? (actionable)
- Does it have clear acceptance criteria?
- Can it be verified when complete?
- If too large, break it down further

One task per build iteration maximizes smart zone utilization.

## D11: Determine Task Dependencies

For each task:
- What other tasks must complete first?
- What tasks can run in parallel?
- What tasks block other work?
- Document dependencies explicitly
