# Decide: Story Task Plan

## D7: Generate Complete Plan for Story Incorporation into Specs

Based on story analysis and incorporation strategy:
- What spec files need to be created?
- What spec files need to be updated?
- What sections need to be added?
- What acceptance criteria need to be defined?
- What data structures need to be documented?
- What algorithms need to be described?
- What examples need to be provided?

Generate a complete plan - don't incrementally patch. Plans are disposable.

## D9: Structure Plan by Priority (Most Important First)

Order the tasks:
- What must be done first? (foundational specs, core concepts)
- What depends on other tasks?
- What can be parallelized?
- What has highest impact?
- What blocks other work?

## D10: Break into Tight, Actionable Tasks

For each item in the plan:
- Is it small enough for one iteration? (tight task)
- Is it clearly defined? (actionable)
- Does it have clear acceptance criteria?
- Can it be verified when complete?
- If too large, break it down further

One task per build iteration maximizes smart zone utilization.

## D11: Determine Task Dependencies

For each task:
- What other tasks must complete first?
- What tasks can run in parallel?
- What tasks block other work?
- Document dependencies explicitly
