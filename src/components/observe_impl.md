## O3: Study AGENTS.md for Specification/Implementation Definitions

Identify from AGENTS.md:
- What constitutes "implementation" in this repository?
- What file paths or patterns define implementation?
- What should be excluded? (tests, build artifacts, vendor, etc.)
- What constitutes "specification"?
- How do specs and implementation relate?

## O4: Study AGENTS.md for Quality Criteria Definitions

Identify from AGENTS.md:
- What boolean quality criteria apply to implementation?
- What thresholds trigger refactoring?
- What specific metrics or checks are used?

## O12: Study Implementation per AGENTS.md Definition

Examine the implementation:
