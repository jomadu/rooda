# Orient: Story Task Incorporation

## R9: Analyze Story from Task File

Study the story description from the task file:
- What is the scope of this feature?
- What are the core requirements?
- What integration points exist with current system?
- What user outcomes does this enable?
- What are the acceptance criteria?

## R11: Understand Existing Spec Structure and Patterns

Study the specifications to understand:
- How are specs currently organized? (by JTBD, by component, by feature)
- What patterns do existing specs follow?
- What level of detail is typical?
- How are acceptance criteria expressed?
- How are data structures documented?
- How are algorithms described?

## R12: Determine How Story Should Be Incorporated

Based on the story analysis and spec patterns, determine:
- Should this create new spec files? (new JTBD or topic of concern)
- Should this update existing specs? (extends current functionality)
- Should this refactor specs? (changes how existing specs are organized)
- Which specific spec files are affected?
- What sections need to be added or modified?

## R14: If Draft Plan Exists - Critique It

If a draft plan file exists from a previous iteration:
- Is it complete? (covers all aspects of the story)
- Is it accurate? (correctly understands the story requirements)
- Are priorities correct? (most important work first)
- Is it clear? (tasks are well-defined and actionable)
- What needs to be adjusted?

## R15: Identify Tasks Needed

Based on the incorporation strategy, identify:
- What spec files need to be created?
- What spec files need to be updated?
- What sections need to be added?
- What acceptance criteria need to be defined?
- What data structures need to be documented?
- What algorithms need to be described?
- What examples need to be provided?

Break down into discrete, implementable tasks.
