# Act: Plan

## A8: Write Draft Plan File per AGENTS.md

Write the draft plan to the location specified in AGENTS.md:
- Use prioritized bullet-point task list format
- Most important tasks first
- Include task descriptions (clear, actionable)
- Document dependencies if applicable
- Include acceptance criteria where relevant
- Make it complete - plans are disposable, cheap to regenerate

## A6: Update AGENTS.md if Learned Something New

If operational learnings occurred during planning:
- Update AGENTS.md with new information
- Capture the why - document rationale
- Keep it up to date
- Examples: discovered new patterns, clarified definitions, refined quality criteria

## A2: Commit Changes

Commit draft plan and any AGENTS.md updates:
- Descriptive commit message
- What plan was created (story/bug/gap/refactor)
- What was learned
- Reference source (story ID, bug ID, etc.)
