# Write Draft Plan

You must create a draft plan file (PLAN.md) with the prioritized tasks. Use the file writing tool.

Create or update PLAN.md with task breakdown.

Include:
- Overview and objectives
- Task list with descriptions
- Priorities and dependencies
- Acceptance criteria for each task
- Implementation notes

After writing the plan, validate your output:
- Is it minimal? (No unnecessary tasks)
- Is it complete? (All requirements covered)
- Is it accurate? (Tasks match requirements)

Only proceed to emit_success if validation passes.
