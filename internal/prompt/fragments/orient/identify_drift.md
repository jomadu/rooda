# Identify Drift

Your task is to categorize the discrepancies between documented and actual repository state.

Categorize inconsistencies between documentation and reality.

Classify drift by type:
- Missing documentation (detected but not documented)
- Stale documentation (documented but no longer accurate)
- Configuration drift (settings changed but not updated)
- Structural drift (organization changed but not reflected)
