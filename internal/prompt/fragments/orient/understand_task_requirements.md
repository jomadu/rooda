# Understand Task Requirements

Your task is to parse the task description into concrete requirements.

Extract and identify:
- Functional requirements (what must be built)
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
- Constraints and limitations
- Success criteria
- Dependencies on other work
