# Identify Implemented But Not Specified

Your task is to find implementation that exists but is not covered by specifications.

Find code that exists but isn't documented in specifications.

Compare implementation to specs:
- Functions without specification coverage
- Features not mentioned in specs
- Configuration options not documented
- Edge case handling not specified
- APIs that lack specification
