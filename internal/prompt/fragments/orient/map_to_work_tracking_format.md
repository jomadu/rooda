# Map to Work Tracking Format

Your task is to convert the draft plan tasks into the format required by the work tracking system.

Convert plan tasks to work tracking system format.

Transform each task to match:
- Work tracking system's field requirements
- Priority scale (e.g., P0-P4 for beads)
- Status values
- Label or tag conventions
- Relationship types (blocks, depends on, etc.)
