# Prioritize Findings

Your task is to order the audit findings by priority.

Order audit findings by severity and impact.

Consider:
- Severity (critical, high, medium, low)
- Impact on users or system
- Frequency of occurrence
- Effort to fix
- Risk if left unaddressed

Rank findings from most to least important.
