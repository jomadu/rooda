# Categorize Drift Severity

Your task is to rank the drift items by severity and impact.

Rank drift items by how critical they are to fix.

Categories:
- Critical: Blocks work or causes failures
- High: Misleading or significantly outdated
- Medium: Incomplete or partially accurate
- Low: Minor inconsistencies or cosmetic issues

Assign severity to each drift item.
