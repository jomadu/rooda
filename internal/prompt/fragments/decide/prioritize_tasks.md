# Prioritize Tasks

Order tasks by importance and dependencies.

Consider:
- Critical path items first
- Dependencies (prerequisite tasks before dependent tasks)
- Risk (high-risk items early for validation)
- Value delivery (high-value items prioritized)
- Effort (quick wins vs long-term investments)
