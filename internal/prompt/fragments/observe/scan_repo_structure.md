# Scan Repository Structure

Your task is to examine the directory structure and key files in the repository. Use the file system tools to explore the repository.

Identify:
- Root-level configuration files
- Source code directories
- Documentation directories
- Test directories
- Build artifacts and output directories

Store this structural information for use in later phases.
