## O13: Study Repository Structure

Examine the repository to understand:
- File tree structure (directories, organization)
- What programming languages are used?
- What build files exist? (package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, pom.xml, Makefile, etc.)
- What configuration files exist? (.github/, .gitlab-ci.yml, etc.)
- What dependency management is used?
- What is the project layout? (src/, lib/, app/, tests/, docs/, etc.)

## O14: Study Existing Documentation

Read available documentation:
- README.md (project description, setup, usage)
- CONTRIBUTING.md (development workflow)
- docs/ directory (if present)
- specs/ directory (if present)
- Inline code documentation
- API documentation
- Architecture diagrams or design docs

## O15: Study Implementation Patterns

Examine existing code to identify:
- Code organization patterns
- Naming conventions
- Module structure
- Testing patterns
- Error handling patterns
- Logging patterns
- Common utilities or helpers
- Architectural patterns (MVC, layered, microservices, etc.)
