# Study Specifications

You must study specification files per AGENTS.md. Use the file reading tool.

Read all files matching spec patterns. For each, extract:
- Job to be Done (JTBD) - core problem
- Acceptance criteria - success conditions
- Examples - usage scenarios
- Cross-references to other specs
- Implementation status

Remember for later analysis.
