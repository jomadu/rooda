# Study Implementation

You must study implementation files per AGENTS.md. Use the file reading tool.

Read all files matching implementation patterns. For each, analyze:
- Code structure and organization
- Key functions, classes, entry points
- Dependencies and imports
- Design patterns and architecture
- Current state and completeness

Remember for later analysis.
