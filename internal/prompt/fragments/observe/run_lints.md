# Run Lints

Your task is to execute lint commands as defined in AGENTS.md. Use the bash execution tool to run these commands.

Run linters and capture:
- Lint violations and warnings
- Code style issues
- Potential bugs or anti-patterns
- Lint rule violations by severity

Store the lint results for use in later phases.
