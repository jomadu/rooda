# Verify Commands

Your task is to test that commands documented in AGENTS.md execute successfully. Use the bash execution tool to run these commands.

Verify:
- Build commands run without errors
- Test commands execute (even if tests fail)
- Lint commands are available
- Work tracking commands respond correctly

Store the verification results for use in later phases.
