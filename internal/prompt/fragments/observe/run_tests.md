# Run Tests

Your task is to execute test commands as defined in AGENTS.md. Use the bash execution tool to run these commands.

Run the test suite and capture:
- Test results (pass/fail counts)
- Failed test details
- Test coverage metrics (if available)
- Test execution time

Store the test results for use in later phases.
