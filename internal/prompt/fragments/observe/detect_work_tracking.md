# Detect Work Tracking System

Your task is to identify the work tracking system in use. Use the file system tools to scan for work tracking indicators.

Look for:
- .beads/ directory (beads)
- .github/issues/ or .github/workflows/ (GitHub Issues)
- .gitlab/ (GitLab Issues)
- tasks.md, TODO.md (file-based tracking)
- JIRA configuration files

Store the detected work tracking system information for use in later phases.
