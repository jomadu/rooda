Based on your orientation:

1. Generate a complete plan for adjusting specs to drive the bug fix
2. Structure the plan by priority (most important spec changes first)
3. Break spec adjustments into tight, actionable tasks
4. Determine which specs need updates and what acceptance criteria to add

Make a clear decision about the complete plan structure and priorities.
