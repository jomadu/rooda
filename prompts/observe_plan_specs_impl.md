Study AGENTS.md first to understand:
- What constitutes "specification" in this repository
- What constitutes "implementation" in this repository
- How to build and test

Then study:
- Plan file (per AGENTS.md - current state and most important task)
- Specifications (per AGENTS.md definition)
- Implementation (per AGENTS.md definition, file tree, symbols, but not full files)

Focus on gathering information needed to understand the current state and what work needs to be done.
