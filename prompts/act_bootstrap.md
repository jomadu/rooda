Execute your decision:

1. Create AGENTS.md with:
   - Project overview (what it is, tech stack)
   - How to build/run/test (specific commands)
   - What constitutes "specification" (file paths/patterns)
   - What constitutes "implementation" (file paths/patterns)
   - Quality criteria for specifications (clarity, completeness, consistency, testability)
   - Quality criteria for implementation (cohesion, coupling, complexity, maintainability)
2. Keep it concise (~60 lines)
3. Capture the why behind definitions
4. Commit changes

AGENTS.md is the operational guide that all other tasks depend on.
