Based on your orientation:

1. Generate a complete plan for incorporating the task into specs
2. Structure the plan by priority (most important tasks first)
3. Break incorporation into tight, actionable tasks
4. Determine task dependencies and which specs need creation/updates

Make a clear decision about the complete plan structure and priorities.
