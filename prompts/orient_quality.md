Based on your observations and AGENTS.md criteria:

1. Apply boolean criteria (PASS/FAIL) to what you observed
   - For specifications: clarity, completeness, consistency, testability
   - For implementation: cohesion, coupling, complexity, maintainability
2. Identify human markers (TODOs, "REFACTORME", unclear language, code smells)
3. Score each criterion as PASS or FAIL
4. Resolve issues or document them

Synthesize your quality assessment and identify areas that fail the threshold.
