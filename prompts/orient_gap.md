Based on your observations:

1. Compare specifications against implementation (or vice versa)
2. Search codebase thoroughly (don't assume not implemented)
3. Identify gaps (what's missing or mismatched)
4. Assess completeness and accuracy

Synthesize your understanding of the gaps and what needs to be addressed.
