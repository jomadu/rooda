Based on your observations:

1. Analyze the feature from the feature file (scope, requirements, integration points)
2. Understand existing spec structure and patterns
3. Determine how the feature should be incorporated:
   - Create new spec files?
   - Update existing spec files?
   - Refactor existing specs?
4. If plan file exists: critique it (completeness, accuracy, priorities, clarity)
5. Identify what tasks are needed for proper incorporation

Synthesize your understanding of how to incorporate the feature and what the plan should contain.
