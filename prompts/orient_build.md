Based on your observations:

1. Understand the specific task requirements from the plan file (per AGENTS.md)
2. Search codebase thoroughly (don't assume not implemented - this is critical)
3. Identify what needs to be built or modified in the implementation
4. Determine the test strategy per AGENTS.md

Synthesize your understanding of what work needs to be done and how to approach it.
