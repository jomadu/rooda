Execute your decision:

1. Implement using parallel subagents (only 1 subagent for build/tests)
2. Run tests per AGENTS.md (backpressure)
3. Update plan file (mark task complete or update status)
4. Update AGENTS.md if you learned something new (capture the why, keep it up to date)
5. Commit when tests pass (after all file updates)

Do not commit if tests fail. Update plan file with the failure and what needs to be fixed.
