Study AGENTS.md first to understand:
- What constitutes "specification" in this repository
- What constitutes "implementation" in this repository

Then study:
- Task file (per AGENTS.md - the feature/story to be incorporated)
- Plan file (per AGENTS.md - current plan state, may not exist on first iteration)
- Specifications (per AGENTS.md definition)
- Implementation (per AGENTS.md definition - file tree and symbols)

Focus on gathering information needed to understand the task and how it should be incorporated into the specs.
