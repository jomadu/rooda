Based on your observations:

1. Analyze the bug from the task directory (symptoms, root cause, affected functionality)
2. Understand existing spec structure and patterns
3. Determine how the spec should be adjusted to drive the fix:
   - Update acceptance criteria to catch the bug?
   - Add missing edge cases to spec?
   - Clarify ambiguous requirements that led to the bug?
   - Add new test scenarios?
4. If plan file exists in task directory: critique it (completeness, accuracy, priorities, clarity)
5. Identify what spec changes are needed to prevent this class of bug

Synthesize your understanding of how to adjust specs to drive the bug fix and prevent recurrence.
