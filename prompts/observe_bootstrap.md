Study the repository to understand its structure and operational characteristics:

1. Repository structure (file tree, directory organization)
2. Programming languages and tech stack
3. Build files (package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, pom.xml, etc.)
4. Existing documentation (README.md, docs/, specs/)
5. Implementation patterns and code organization
6. Test files and testing patterns

Focus on gathering empirical information needed to create an operational guide (AGENTS.md).
