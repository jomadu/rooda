Study AGENTS.md first to understand:
- What constitutes "specification" in this repository
- What constitutes "implementation" in this repository

Then study:
- Story file in the task directory (the feature to be incorporated)
- Plan file in the task directory (current plan state - may not exist on first iteration)
- Specifications (per AGENTS.md definition)
- Implementation (per AGENTS.md definition - file tree and symbols)

Focus on gathering information needed to understand the story and how it should be incorporated into the specs.
