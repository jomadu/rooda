# OODA Loop

The OODA loop is a decision-making framework developed by military strategist John Boyd. It stands for:

**Observe** - Gather information from your environment and situation

**Orient** - Analyze and synthesize the information based on your experience, culture, and mental models

**Decide** - Determine a course of action based on your analysis

**Act** - Execute the decision

The key insight is that this is a continuous loop, not a linear process. After acting, you immediately return to observing the results and environmental changes.

## Why it matters

- Speed through the loop creates competitive advantage - if you can cycle faster than your opponent, you can disrupt their decision-making
- The "Orient" phase is often considered the most critical, as it's where biases, assumptions, and mental models can either help or hinder decision quality
- Originally developed for aerial combat, it's now applied to business strategy, software development, cybersecurity, and other competitive domains

## In software/tech contexts

- Agile methodologies mirror OODA principles with rapid iteration cycles
- DevOps practices (observe metrics > orient around data > decide on changes > act/deploy) follow this pattern
- Incident response and security operations use OODA to respond faster than attackers

The framework emphasizes adaptability and continuous learning over rigid planning.
